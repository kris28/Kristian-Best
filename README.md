I was on my way to school in the middle of a snow blizzard and as I was making a left turn into the school my car slipped and hydroplained and I ran into a truck.As soon as the crash happened I pulled over shocked that I had just had my first car accident.I pulled over and no one was injured and there was very minor damage to neither of our cars.Once I met the parent that I got into an accident with we started talking and he gave me his bussines card. I read it and he has his own anti virus protection company.He continued our conversation and He told me about how launch Code guided him threw the steps of code and landed him a job after he worked hard threw the course. This scary accident changed my life, and after this happend I learned to never let anything get me down because God is watching over me and I beleave that accident changed my life . Now Im a member of the Blue1647 class and im loving every second of it.

I was born october 28th 1998, in St.louis Mo. I am currently 17 years old. I attend Parkway North High school. I have one big brother named Charles.Charles is seven years older than me. Charles and I grew up with a love for cars. Every car we saw growing up we were pointing at and making coments on them a if they were ours. Daydreaming about all the different ways we could customize it and make it specail to us.Today we turned our dreams into reality and perform custom and factory paint jobs for friends and family , soon we will expand.To see pictures click this link. As a kid , I loved video games , and I still do. I've always loved phones too. I remember helping explain a phone to my aunt because she didnt know what phone to get and the worker was on her first day and didnt know either. Technology and everything about it has always internested me. I took robotics classes last year and this year I just started taking web design and intro to computer science.Im also taking design tech currently.

After I graduate high school I plan on being a full time launch code student.I feel that Launch code is the best path for me and I want to learn as much as I can with it. After Launch Code leads me in the right direction , I'll have a good job in the feild that I love. Along with working, I plan on eventually opening a website design company traveling around the world meeting new people and spreading news about launch code.
